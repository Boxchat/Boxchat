# Boxchat-Hybrid
A Secure Private Chat Platform.

# CAUTION
This project is already a branch of the Boxchat, and we may not update the Boxchat of this architecture in the future. We should transfer the project to Boxchat Native. Because I think that using the native APP architecture is a responsible behavior for the user.
